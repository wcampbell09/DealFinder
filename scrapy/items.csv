VERY heavy bring help to load. only reason for selling is because we have no room in our new place. This table has lots of life in it. If your looking for perfect, go spend a grand like I did and get it brand new. We have kids and there is blemishes. So don'tcome thinking nit picking every scratch or mark on seat will make me give it away. I'm literally asking 90% from the purchase price due to the blemishes.

Eclipse elliptical training exercise walking in place machine. Model 1100 HR/A. Was working fine last time used. ,
About this item,
Description,
Product Description,
Eclipse 1100HRA sleek and quiet, the Eclipse 1100HRA elliptical crosstrainer offers an expanded electronics package and magnetic resistance system, including Heart Rate Control Programs.,
Amazon.com,
Sleek and quiet, the Eclipse 1100 HR/A elliptical cross trainer from Fitness Quest makes a terrific home workout accessory. The trainer showcases a unique, patented orbital linkage system that provides you with a smooth elliptical pattern as you work out. As a result, the trainer's quiet, low-impact stride feels completely natural and is exceptionally smooth through the entire range of motion. The machine's expanded electronics package, meanwhile, includes an easy-to-use fitness computer that tracks time, speed, distance, and approximate calories burned. And thanks to the 10 preset workout programs and two heart rate control programs, you can easily define a workout pace that's comfortable yet challenging.,
,
Another handy feature is the 1100 HR/A's focus bar, which features built-in hand pulse sensors for immediate heart rate readings. This gives you a convenient way to keep track of your heart rate, helping you stay within the target zone and maximize your calorie burn. Other details include large, slip-resistant foot pedals designed for stability and ample foot room, a 15-inch stride length, a water bottle holder and reading rack, and a set of bottom wheels for easy transport. The trainer, which holds up to 275 pounds, measures 22.5 by 64 by 41 inches (W x H x D), weighs 90 pounds, and carries a one-year warranty.,
,
About Elliptical Trainers,
Elliptical trainers represent the next wave of advancement in low-impact cardiovascular exercise machines and continue to grow in popularity. By simulating motions experienced through walking, stepping, cycling, and skiing, elliptical machines allow for a smooth and fluid motion while building strength in the arms and legs. Similar to the exercise position for treadmills, elliptical trainers are used by standing in an upright position while holding the handrails of the machine. With elliptical trainers, however, your feet remain in the foot pedals throughout the exercise regimen and circulate in a smooth and seamless motion, resulting in little to no impact on the knees, back, and hips.,
,
Elliptical trainers are compatible for all ages and fitness levels and allow you to select the difficulty level through the incline and intensity settings. Additionally, elliptical trainers allow you to determine the complexity of your workout based on your needs, all while listening to music, watching television, or reading a magazine while exercising in the comfort and safety of your own home.,
,
Although different types of elliptical trainers offer an assortment of features, many of them include an array of challenging programs, forward and reverse directional movement, EKG grip pulse handles, a lightweight portable design with easy fold-up capability, and a monitor displaying calories burned, distance, speed, time, and heart rate. Other types of exercise machines, namely treadmills and bikes, offer excellent cardiovascular exercise and muscular training for the legs in a forward-motion exercise. Elliptical trainers take this to the next level by offering an upper and lower body workout with dual motion, challenging and diverse programs, and a low-impact exercise machine that won't strain sensitive joints.,

One lot of 11 books Autographed by their authors.  I have been an online seller of books and other items for 15 years and, at age 77, must retire. This is one of several lots of items I have removed from my online store. They are currently listed (by other sellers) and being sold online.  The average asking price is sometimes hard to determine as there are so few autographed copies.   I WAS ASKING FOR AT LEAST $10 each plus $4.00 shipping (your cost to ship = $2.75) or a retail value for the lot of $154. You can have the whole lot for only $10.00. Look them up on Amazon, eBay or Alibris and see for yourself.,

Selling my 1997 GMC C1500 extended cab long bed truck. Has a 5.7L Vortec gas engine. Works great. I have been the owner since 2007. Clean title in hand. Always kept up with maintenance. I always used premium replacement parts like AC Delco, Moog, etc. I put a brand new AC Delco alternator in it about 6 months ago, and I also replaced the idler pulley and serpentine belt. Has a $500 spray in bed liner. Rear seats fold up for extra storage. Has a spare tire stored under the bed. Has a class III trailer hitch installed on the back. Has a jack stored under the rear seat. I'm selling this truck because I needed something bigger to pull a larger trailer. I have an aftermarket bluetooth mp3 player radio jukebox installed, but I also have the factory radio I will include in the sale.    ", (Ft White)

VERY RARE. THESE ARE THREE 83-86 YEAR OLD ORIGINAL PRINTED AND PUBLISHED IN BERLIN, GERMANY FROM 1933-1936 MUSIC MAGAZINES. THEY WERE PRINTED JUNE 1933, SEPTEMBER 1935, AND APRIL 1936. ""DIE MUSIC"" WAS ESTABLISHED IN 1901 AND IN JULY, 1933 WAS TAKEN OVER BY ADOLPH HITLER'S 3RD REICH. THE COVER AND BACKS HAVE SEPARATED FROM THE BODY'S OF THE MAGAZINES WHICH COMMENSURATE WITH THEIR AGES AS THESE MAGAZINES ARE VERY OLD. THE PAPER IN ALL 3 ISSUES HAS SOME VERY MINOR DISCOLORATION FROM AGE.,
,
PRINT IN GOOD CONDITION, NO MISSING OR WRITTEN ON PAGES IN ANY OF THE 3 MAGAZINES. THE APRIL 1936 MAGAZINE HAS REMOVABLE INSERTS THAT WERE INCLUDED IN THAT ISSUE. THESE ARE SHOWN IN PIC #6 AND ARE 83 YEARS OLD.,
,
DIE MUSIC'S FINAL PUBLICATION WAS FEBRUARY 1943 WHEN GERMANY WAS REBUILDING FROM THE WAR. IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO FIND ANY OF THESE AROUND ANYWHERE IN EXISTENCE. THIS IS A VERY NICE VERY RARE COLLECTIBLE.,

The SessionBass amp design includes controls for Pre-Gain, Contour, Low, Mid, Mid-Shift, Highs, and an Output Volume control, as well as a Bright Switch, DDT Compression On/off switch, a Line Out XLR output for feeding a signal to a mixing board or PA System, Effects Send and Return and more. All the features any performing bassist who plays live or studio music will appreciate and use.
,

Amphead works perfectly and is in very good condition. It's been kept in my non-smoking studio.  It sounds great and has a lot of tonality flexibility, which is what I like best about it, plus plenty of wattage for any venue.
,

Serious professionals only. If that's you, let me know. But, if you are a foreign spammer, don't waste your time sending me a bogus inquiry - I only respond to local inquiries that include a name and other local information.
,

Two pics show the SessionBass amphead installed in a Gator brand portable systems rack.   Gator rack-bag is not included in the price, but is negotiable.   Another pic shows the SessionBass sitting atop a Kustom B215 speaker cabinet, which is sold separately. Cables not included.    ", (SW Gainesville)

Allison MD 3060 heavy-duty 6-speed automatic transmission (TID-2).  With torque converter.  Zero Miles.  Clean.  This was purchased from Polk County Schools at surplus auction.  Was stored in warehouse as spare for school buses until very recently.  This model transmission is commonly used in school buses, garbage trucks, motor homes, and emergency vehicles.  See spec-sheet in photo for more details.,
,
$2,000 CASH!   NO CORE CHARGE!   NO SALES TAX!  Will also accept Western Union wire transfer, or US Postal Money Order.,
,
This is a professionally re-manufactured unit built in November 2013 by Reliable Transmission - an authorized Allison Dealer.  See serial number, stock number, and part number in photos.  Also, phone number for Reliable - please call them with any specific questions.  I cannot provide any warranty for this unit, but perhaps Reliable will, as it has never been installed.  Sold As-Is.  Please use due care  when installing.  The School Board warehouse guy said that it contains some fluid, but that it is probably not full.  Check fluid level before operation.,
,
Some notes from Reliable website: ,
,
""Rebuilding and remanufacturing are two different procedures. Rebuilding is a process of repairing or replacement of internal transmission failed parts. At RTS we fully remanufacture every transmission to meet the Federal Trade Commission guidelines. To meet these guidelines we replace all non-serviceable parts, perform engineering updates, and test every remanufactured transmission with computer controlled dynamometer to insure maximum durability for proper transmission operation."",
,
Located in Gainesville, FL (32608).  Price includes local pickup only.  Unit weighs approximately 550 pounds.  I have a boom-type engine hoist, and I can help you load it into the bed of a normal pickup, van, or trailer, at no extra charge.,
,
Shipping:  I will work with YOUR shipping company if you arrange a pickup at a business address in Gainesville, FL (32601).  Unit will be on a pallet in the bed of an F150 pickup.  No forklift or pallet jack available, so they would need lift-gate and pallet jack.  I can also DELIVER within a 200 mile radius for an additional fee of $2.00 per mile (measured one-way).,
,
Update:  I can also get you a shipping quote from Southeastern Freight.  You will need to send address and whether or not you need lift-gate service.    ", (Gainesville)

Selling my scooter. It's a 250cc scooter, so the engine is much bigger and it's a lot faster than any of the smaller scooters, but it's still an automatic. I've gone as fast as 80 on it, but I wouldn't take it on the interstate. It's got plenty of storage space and almost everything works great. It's got about 19,000 miles on it (speedometer is in km) but still runs good. The only thing in not so great shape aesthetically is the seat, it's starting to come apart at the seams. I've restitched some of it and covered it with some tape as a stopgap measure. It's just an aesthetic issue, I'm sure you can cover it up with something if it's an issue. I haven't used it much since I graduated so I'm selling it. The price is firm. Feel free to call or text with any questions, although I'll probably be able to get back to you sooner by text. If you call and I don't pick up, please leave a voicemail so I know it's not a robocall.    "," (Gainesville, FL)"

Celebrate the arrival of football season with a new smoker.  My two sons 13 and 17 have built two 120 gallon vertical smoker.  The smokers have three racks that can be moved to six different levels.  They have a large firebox in the bottom with a large damper and smoke stake also has a damper to enable you to have greater control over the heat.  Feel free to give us a call if you have any questions or would like to come out and pick one up.,
,
I am proud of my boys.  Instead of sitting on the couch watching TV they set out on a project.  A much bigger project than originally believed.  They started with two 120 gallon LP tanks and finished with a nice pair of smokers.  But the gained so much more.  They built on their already strong work ethic, putting in sometimes 15 to 16 hour work days.  They developed metal working skills to include but not limited to welding and using a cutting torch.  They grew in independence as well as their ability to work as a team.  ,

Thank you for looking at our add and we would greatly appreciate it if you passed it on so we can empty the shop and start on something new.    ", (Live Oak)

This is an antique Spanker used in various Fraternal Orders and in Theater. This was used in most initiation rituals where the acolyte would be struck in the rear, usually while blindfolded, as one part of the ritual.,
These would be loaded with a blank cartridge that would blow when struck, creating a really loud BANG to freak out the initiate.,
That is definitely a once in a lifetime find. An extensive search of the internet does not show any other paddle like this.,
Size is 25 inches long, 5 1/4 inches wide at the widest part of Spanker.,
The handle is wood and the paddle part is leather.,
On the reverse of the paddle is a metal plate which says The M.C. Lilley & Co. Military & Society Goods Columbus Ohio.,

WARRANTY INFO-,
,
Warranty is 90 days unlimited miles. ,

Warranty does not cover abuse such as the transmission having water in it or being run low on oil for ANY reason including but not limited to seal failure or oil not being put in at the time of installation( if you installed it). ,
,
After you have the vehicle back or it's back on the road (if you installed it) it is YOUR  responsibility to keep an eye on transmission/transfer case and check for leaks.,
,
If a leak is discovered it is up to you to contact me at which point I will fix the leak. ,
If the unit is damaged by not contacting me or from you not noticing the leak, it will not be covered under warranty.,
,
Warranty also does not cover shipping, installation labor (unless I installed it), towing costs or any other costs or damages that may occur due to failure of a unit or component.,
,
Unit will be repaired including parts and labor should a unit have an issue, or the unit will be replaced if it cannot be repaired.,
,
I have a very high success rate (95%) due to my OCD and only building Jeeps.,

This is a Marshall 4x12"" cabinet with four 30 watt  celestion speakers. Allegedly, this was a Marshall prototype for a lighter body cabinet. I cannot verify this: previously Owned by (then) local rocker Craiger White (I bought it from him around 27 years ago). Speakers replaced along the way, as needed. It sounds great and looks great in a house. Could use a fresh coat of varnish to really make it pop... or fabric-wrap it if you want to gig with it. Spots for casters. If you are in a gigging band and/or just want an affordable, cool cabinet: this is the one for you.,

The footboard adapts to (I believe) queen-bed size.  Meaning, once you swap out the sides of the crib for a bedframe, you elongate the crib, converting it into a regular bedframe.  You would use the back wall of the crib as the headboard, and then the front wall of the crib can be converted into two different styles for a footboard, since the curved uprights on either side are detachable from the middle wall piece.  Either keep the front crib wall for a tall footboard, or use the matching crossmember (included but not pictured) to create a low-profile footboard that just has the curved uprights at full height.  This could be better explained in-person.  These bed units usually go for about two hundred.,

Rare find: Ivory color 2003 Chinook Premier 21-feet - excellent condition inside & out with many upgrades! One piece molded fiberglass body, for a beautiful, quiet, thermally insulated and leak-free motorhome. This camper is ready to go for your short trips and longer adventures. The compact size and reliable Triton 5.4 Liter V8 (11 mpg) with 4-speed automatic with overdrive enabled us to travel with ease thru congested cities and rugged, remote, mountainous places anywhere. Visiting National Parks that often don’t admit larger rigs was no problem. Completely self-contained and fits in most parking places. The swing-away 15 ft Stowaway locked rotomolded polyethylene storage box is attached to the rear hitch & provides the extra storage that makes long distance trips so much easier. The cutest camper imaginable. We'd never EVER sell it if we lived closer to the Rockies, Alaska and western Canada which are our favorite destinations, but unfortunately we don't. We have all service records for documentation. ,

I have an absolutely like new cosmetically and operationally perfect Frigidaire 10,000 BTU (120 Volt) window air conditioner that I no longer need.  This is THE BEST window unit I have ever owned.  This is a very nice unit with electronic controls which feature a remote control that can operate any and all functions including timer, temperature control, energy saver mode, sleep mode etc.  Also, the air distribution outlets allow infinite control of air direction....the best I have ever seen on a window a/c.

This is an amazing bench with two attachments. Leg extension and chest flys. It’s used, but it’s solid steel, it will last a lifetime. Served me well. But having some financial issues so have to let it go and it PAINS ME TO. I paid over $600 for it all. If you want weights and bars, I got them. Weight is weight normally $1 per LB, you can have it for .75 cents per pound on my plates or dumbbells and I have two kettlebells 30 lb and 15lb. I will not and should not take this apart- you’ll need to see how it goes together so you know for yourself. I will take it apart for you and load it up if you give me no issue on the price, it’s well worth it and it’s a job to take it apart, so once you know where you’ll put it, you’ll want it to stay out. ,
It will be your baby now. If you’re interested let me know a day to come by and let me use it one more week before I have to take it apart. if you don’t mind. I’m gonna miss it and I can’t afford to get another one.    ", (Archer by tower road)

The middle part of the frame is broken so when you sit down in the middle cushion you sing right in there so beautifully. It’s my man couch my son and I love it but the ball and chain wants a new one because fancy pants. She wanted me to let it go for free but she has no idea how hard it is to get this inside and outside of my trailer door.  If you want this thing just give me 20 bucks because getting it out is going to suck because my door is really narrow and I have to do a whole bunch of careful squeezing to not damage the couch any further or my door so just give me 20 bucks cause I’m gonna get really sweaty and it’s hot outside. If you’re not a fancy pants and you want a leather couch that’s comfortable to take a nap on come on and get it.  Please don’t ask for delivery or if I will take $10. It’s really hot outside this is going to be work for me and I’ll even load it onto your truck.    ", (Archer road by tower)

READY FOR THE WATER! 99 Searay Sundeck 210 Very good condition,
Great family boat. Call for more details. 386-868-5039,

Class Power,
Category Bowrider, Deck Boats,

Fuel Type Gas,

The 210 Sundeck from Sea Ray was built for all-day fun while providing a safe environment for passengers of all ages. With a deep-V hull design and high gunwales, the 210 Sundeck maintains a smooth, steady ride even in heavy wake traffic. With integral swim platforms, ladders, and grab handles fore and aft, access to and from the water is fast and easy - a must when children are in the water. The bow platform features a concealed ladder compartment for easy beach access. Forward and aft walk-throughs make it easy to board from the dock while midship fender locks ensure secure, simple fender tie-offs. A spacious standard seating plan allows lots of room for family and friends with two swivel bucket helm seats and aft bench seating with a removable jump seat. Since the 210 Sundeck is built to handle a variety of pastimes, Sea Ray has made plenty of storage space available in the cockpit side panels, under the starboard dash, and in a ski and kneeboard storage compartment in the floor, featuring vinyl matting to prevent mold and mildew. Everything remains securely stowed out of sight, so there's nothing to trip over. The 210 Sundeck even has a tinted curved glass windshield and a vinyl-baked Bimini top to provide shade. With a standard 5.0L 220 horsepower Alpha I MCM stern drive, the Sea Ray 210 Sundeck packs plenty of power for pulling skiers or tubers. Everything's there for a full day in the sun, including a cocktail table, snap-in carpet liner, pressure water shower, sink with sprayer, and a large enclosed, lockable head area. Other standard features on the 210 Sundeck include an automatic bilge pump, electric bilge blower, tilt steering on the chrome sport steering wheel, power tilt and trim, power steering, custom Sea Ray backlit instrumentation, engine alarms, and a pearl gelcoat hull with a choice of red, blue, green, or black and gold graphics. Plenty of options including engine upgrades, a portable head and sunpad filler cushion - just to name a few - all combine to make the 210 Sundeck one of the safest and most enjoyable family crafts on the water.

This fireproof cabinet is very large. Both doors open smoothly and the electronic keypad works perfectly. I can load it on your trailer and I may be able to help deliver if you are close. It can be moved with a pallet jack or forklift. $1500 (pretty firm) I prefer calls over text or email, please call me at 386-22two-005nine with any questions! Thank you!,

Sweet Classic Sidecars Factory direct $4285 manufactured in Melbourne Florida. ,
Enjoy a new motoring experience. Drive with a Sweet Classic Sidecar. ,
,
Been thinking about a sidecar? Look no further. I can custom build you a sidecar for whatever needs you have. Many of my customers need a sidecar to cart around the grand kids. Or in some cases the wife can't ride on the back of the bike any longer. Possibly like many you're having a problem holding up your bike. Then a sidecar could be in your future. I can build you a sidecar and custom fit it to your bike. All my Sweet Classic Sidecars are designed so that they can be removed from the bike in three to five minutes and re installed in five to ten without any adjustments being needed. Every Sweet Sidecar is custom built and installation is included in the price. They come complete with carpet interior . A trunk is included behind the seat back with easy access. Every sidecar comes with a windshield . Your choice of a wheel and fender can be arranged so that it will complement your bike and have just the right look.,
I will teach you how to drive your new sidecar rig taking a lot of the guess work out of it,
If you've been thinking about a sidecar then give me a call. Just ask for Eric or Jack and say ""your interested in one of my Sweet Classic Sidecars"". It's as easy as that    ", (Melbourne)

I have a 1998 Suzuki intruder that does run. clutch recently went out which I'll replace if it sits too long. carbs need cleaned and its dust from sitting. I can spray starter fluid and it'll crank right up so you'll need to clean carbs. I have a clean title and another 98 intruder parts bike to go with it, which also I should still have the title for as well . I'm only looking to trade and no motor cycles. I can't keep off the throttle and don't wanna hurt myself on one so I'm looking for wood trucks, four wheelers, dirt bikes, maybe even Honda civics or something like that. just throw me offers.,

I thoroughly cleaned the lint filter / air duct along with the entire inside of the dryer. It is ready to go.   ,

**This dryer is set up for Propane (LP) as of now. A Natural Gas conversion kit is very easy to install if you need to convert from propane back to natural gas and the kit costs about $15-$20. I will include the natural gas conversion kit with the dryer if you need to convert back to natural gas.** ,

I accept cash, check and all major credit cards.,
I do not live onsite, so All visits are by appointment only and on weekend. I’m located between Jonesville and Archer down Cr241s.,
This is currently all I have dry and ready to use but there’s lots of it.,
Follow me on Facebook for updates when new lumber becomes available by searching “the Florida Woodsmith” or visit me on my website at Floridawoodsmith.com,
I also offer green lumber for $2.50/bf ,
or custom milling service for $1.25-1.50 per linear foot. ,
I’m working hard to become north-central Florida’s best source for quality hardwoods, cedar and sawmilling.,

Attention all concession and restaurant owners who have been looking for a machine that you can do slushies  or milkshakes and NOT have to have 208- 240 V power--this is the one for you! This model was used in a franchise fast food establishment since it was originally acquired. It is a 2008 model. You can check the serial number K8104673 to confirm this. Uses 115V(also known as 110V or 120V) power. Only removed because the franchise was renovating and upgrading equipment. Simple to use. Add your mix to the hopper on top, turn the machine on, and in about 5-10 minutes will freeze down to the viscosity you choose. You can change this depending on the product you choose to dispense. You can either sell one flavor of slush/smoothie/frappe/frozen cocktail margaritas or milkshake or you can use a basemix and then add the flavor or add in for shakes and mix with the spindle mixer shown on the side of the machine. The possibilities are endless.,

A specially designed viscosity control automatically maintains superior product quality. An adjustable control allows the operator to serve a wide variety of frozen beverages at the desired thickness.,
,
Made to be mounted on a countertop with air spaces on left and right side of 3"". This is an air cooled unit. Gravity fed mix delivery system.,
,
16"" wide x 27 1/2"" deep x 27 1/2"" high. Need to leave a little room on top to remove lid and be able to add product. Weighs approx 175#s which makes it easy to move. This unit has legs that can be removed.,
,
Photos show machine set up and working. A commercial refrigeration tech has been through the machine and tested it. It is fully working and operating properly.,
,
The plug on the end of the power cord is a 5-20P. A majority of outlets that are modern can accommodate this configuration since most of them have the openings for both 15 amp straight prongs and this style. It does need 16 amps to operate so it needs a dedicated 20 amp circuit breaker.,
,
If you want to dip your toe into the frozen beverage and shake business this is the machine you want to start with to decide if it is something you want to  continue. And not have to spend a fortune in order to do so.,
,
I have made a copy of the operating manual. It will also come with a tube of the lubricant that you need to use on the seal so that you could put this into use immediately if you have the product.,
,
I have operated this with a generator and it performs well too.,

Just assembled this beast and then had to get a laptop. She’s currently running Windows 10 and the full specs are below,
,
Ryzen 5 3600X- 6 Core processor,
Radeon 5700XT- 8Gb GDDR6,
MSI MPG X570 Motherboard,
16GB Ram- G.Skill Aegis DDR4-3000,
2TB M.2 SSD- Intel 660p Series,
850W 80+ Gold Certified Modular PSU- Corsair RMx,
Fractal Design Meshify C Mid-tower case,
2 Noctua NF-A14 140mm fans,
2 Fractal Design 140mm fans,
Noctua NH-D15 CPU Cooler with 2 140mm fans,
,
This thing is a beast. Can run even PUBG at 1440p Ultra setting over 100fps and with 6 fans this thing will never overheat. The Noctua NH-D15 is famous for being the only air cooler that can out perform water coolers with the reliability of an air. ,
,
The motherboard has built in WiFi and is an X570 so it supports Gen 4 m.2 drives. Every major part just came out within the last two months so it’s future proofed for quite a bit of time. Cost me about 1900 to build so asking 1500    ", (Gainesville)

This beautiful 73"" x 26""hardwood backrest was originally for a futon made in Argentina. I don't know what kind of wood it is but it is quite dense—believe it or not the fella weighs 33 lbs! The structure assembly is very strong, with dowels. As can be seen, one support arm is split (could be glued and mended) and you'll have to come up with your own solution for the other end.

I have for sale a HUGE LOT of sewing machines from a closed repair shop. There are everything from older steel machines to more modern machines. There are a couple commercial tables and motors as well which alone is worth getting this lot. There are several machines in consoles, then some consoles that are ready for machines. Many of the machines have hard cases for storage. These machines are in all various stages of repair, some work, some don't. Some are parts machines. A few would make good boat anchors (lol) There are a few light kits and pedals, some old manuals and misc parts. I bought this lot from an estate and did well with it selling it on ebay etc for parts. (especially some of the obsolete machines) I have now moved and have no where to store. I need to move the entire lot. Although I appreciate your response, I am not interested in selling ones and twos. I was asking $500 OBO for the entire lot. You will need a medium uhaul type truck or good size trailer to haul and help to load as I am disabled and cam offer no help. Please no stupid offers. Thank you for looking and God Bless!    ","

This is my used laminated cabinet that was being used as a china cabinet. Could also be used as an entertainment center or hutch or to store knick knacks or hobbies. It is the typical laminated particle board, (measures 13 inches deep) and the top is unfinished but well worth my asking price of $10 to keep dust off of things. The back, (on the bottom section) does have two small holes, and there is no bottom to this unit (3 sided on the bottom as I had it mounted to another piece of furniture).,

This is my used cypress table that has a small inlaid mirror on the top. The table has a few small cracks and the bottom base is left unstained but will easily last another 50 years, (or refinish for a show quality piece).,
Very stable for an end table or small center coffee table or gaming table-no disappointments here as the unfinished lumber would cost more than my asking price.,

These little ladies found themselves tossed out on the highway.,
They’ve been taken in by a big hearted family and received their first shots, worming, and flea bath. ,
They are now experiencing life with cats, other dogs, goats, cows, and horses.,
Please contact us if you would like to give one of these sweet, little girls a home.,

I bought these off eBay last summer and wore them twice and decided they are not as comfortable as what everybody told me they are.  At least not for me. Others have told me they’re the most comfortable shoes they’ve ever worn. ,
They are comparable to size 8-8 1/2 with Velcro closure that can adjust.,
 They did offer that I could send them back but I decided between the cost of sending them back and the hassle of doing it and waiting for my refund I just left them in the closet. ,
I did pay considerably more than the $10 I’m asking.   So it’s a great buy for you if you like  MEPHISTO brand.   I know this particular style sells for over $100.    ", (SW Gainesville/Tower Road)

Well kept boat.  Comes with everything you need to hit the water.  Including: Paddle and hook, bow and stern anchors, lifejackets, 4 fenders and line. Newer battery with kill switch. New Bimini top and new vinyl on seats!  Boat has been maintenanced yearly.  Safety features, comes with extinguisher and new flares.  Coast Guard inspected and passed.  Boat has been run in fresh and saltwater.  Engine flushed after every use.  Original owner.  ,
Comes with it's original trailer.  Foresee in future:. Helm will need new guages, eventually.  And trailer could use a once over.  ,
I'm heartbroken to sell my boat but I don't have the time anymore to run the boat as it should be.  Kept it in as good shape as I could.  Been together for 13 years.  I'm currently detailing the interior and exterior is receiving a Poli-glow treatment.  Interior pics will be loaded soon. The hull of the boat was treated 3 years ago and has very little crazing.  Solid hull.  I will honor all REASONABLE offers.  I'll answer any questions you may have.  This boat would also make a great starter to a family wanting to get into the boating life!  After purchase, I will give the new owner a free one time engine maintenance with my technician and $50 cash to put towards 90 rec boat fuel.  I'm serious on finding a good home for my boat!

Overall in good condition was just taken down and no use for it.  The crown I believe is about 5 1/4 and the base is what seems to be standard base.  It is stained so if you want it white you will need to prime it and paint it.  nails are also still in it.  I would estimate 100 ft or so of each if you are interested let me know.  You must pick up and schedule a time to pick it up with me.   If you reach out I can text you pictures if needed.   Also they are all 12-16 ft sticks.    ","

,
Cruise America's primary business is renting out Class C motorhomes. They are rented out for about 5 years and my corporate office in Arizona decides when to retire them from our rental fleet and designates a few to be sold to the public. It goes through our refurbishing process where we start by taking off all of the Cruise America graphics, it gets a whole new paint job on the camper and we put the original Majestic graphics back on. Then, we go in the inside to check the appliances; all the appliances need to be in working condition before it's put out for sale. We check the tires/brakes and if they have less than 50% of life on them, they will get new tires/brakes. We even put a 3mo/3,000 powertrain warranty on the engines good at any Ford dealership in the nation.,
,
In Lieu of the Fly/Buy program, Cruise America has a One Way Car Rental program. You can rent a car one way through Enterprise, drop it off at Enterprise down the street from us and their will shuttle you over to our location. Cruise America will send you a rebate check for your car rental up to $300.00 after you take the RV home.,

7. We want to be your restaurant equipment provider for 2019 CALL US.,
,
Why buy restaurant equipment from Shooksales, GENE SHOOK RESTAURANT EQUIPMENT, when many sell similar products? I know restaurant equipment very well. I understand, when I know what items you are cooking and the size and style of your operation, what the best equipment for you will be. I understand the health department rules. I believe in excellent customer service and not to look at a single sale but instead to many sales and referrals over the long run. I understand business and want to be YOUR restaurant equipment supplier for a long time not just a single sale. ,
OK I will probably get arguments for this but how to cook a thick prime steak, 1st just use some salt and pepper fresh ground, take an iron skillet super hot and sear it on both sides with a little oil for just 30 seconds or so, 2nd use a high end steak broiler that is at least 1500 degrees (I love Montague for this) (these are very expensive but great) under cook a little serve on hot plate. if you don't have high end steak broiler sear as above then cook on hottest part of char grill for a few minutes per side, let rest a few minutes and repeat several times (this called long cook) takes longer but does what an expensive steak broiler does (almost). 3rd cook it French style with very hot iron skillet with mixture of oil and some butter turn and baste many times works great just will not have any hair on your wrist and a few burns. Look call me and I can help you with what will work best for your menu. ,
,
My cell is 310 292-1182 call and I can give you the final sale price with delivery. Customers consistently tell me they were quoted for used items more than I am selling a new one for. Many times, a new one is cheaper than the repair cost of your old unit.,
FASTEST SHIPPING,
I SHIP From multiple Warehouses Across USA A Typical delivery averages about 2 to 3 business days.,
,
EXPERT ADVISE THAT COULD SAVE YOU FROM COSTLY MISTAKES.,
I am one of the largest sellers of MANY BRANDS in the USA. I know refrigeration and cooking equipment extensively. I will help guide you to the proper piece of equipment you truly need. I have talked a number of customers out of buying some items because it was not right for them. When you share with me information about your business, I can guide you to the right, precise size and proper piece of equipment you will need. I am knowledgeable about many types of equipment manufacturers and understand the pros and cons of different units.,
,
SHOULD I BUY NEW OR USED?,
It is always nice to save money, but what about good, used equipment? Many refrigerators will last up to 20 years, but I consider the actual lifespan to be about 10 years. If a unit is 10 to 15 years old, there is no real value for the unit even if it is working today. If it is 8 years old, you may get some use out of it. It is common that a customer will tell me they found a 2-year-old 2 door freezer for $2000. When I look up the serial numbers it may be 15 plus years' old I find it not to be working properly and really no value (if seller does not know age beware, you can always call manufacture with serial number and they will tell you how old unit is or call or text me). On working correctly, they say it cools down, but working and working correctly can be a BIG difference. For a freezer, it must reach 0 degrees to negative 10 degrees, on refrigerator it must be between 33 degrees and 40 degrees. So, a freezer at 10 degrees and refrigerator at 45 degrees are working but will not pass a health inspection. When you buy used, they usually don't have a warranty, you have to arrange transport. If it is only a couple years old and it is super cheap you can consider it, but please do not pay a lot for an old unit that may be full of headaches. Many times, I am able to sell a NEW unit at a similar price to what others will sell used AND it has full warranty.,

Reply with your name and address and contact info with list of items you need and I can provide you with written estimate right away. When replying also give your email address as Craigslist hides actual email.,

For those that have read this long add PLEASE call me at 310-292-1182 and I will earn your business, and if you like what I do please review us on Yelp or Google and like us on Facebook (SHOOKSALES), and if you don’t like what I do PLEASE review us on Yelp or Google, I only ask for honesty in reviews.,

Looking for big land? This lush pasture has been meticulously maintained by the former owner. Pasture weeds were removed by hand, no pesticides were sprayed and cattle leftovers have been dragged throughout to help with the new growth. Beautiful oak trees surround this location to help with privacy. This pasture is fenced all the way around and trees have been cleared from the fence line. You can access the land from the East side of the lot. A cross fence is also in place if you need to keep a healthy rotation in the livestock and grass. May be divided into four 5 acre lots. Check covenants for details. Water is available to land but it will need an additional well and be redirected.    ", (High Springs)

I just spent the last few hours cleaning and testing everything. Everything works, but bear in mind it's all over 30 years old so it's not perfect nor is it new. Many of the games work on the first or second try. I am not breaking anything up or selling anything individually, so please don't ask. I've looked up each piece and know what it's worth. Thanks for looking. ,

Selling 2015 Wilier Triestina Blade Tri/TT bike, size 54 cm. This bike weighs in at 19 lbs and features a full carbon frame and fork, awesome aerodynamic advantages, a solid set of Ultegra components, and a set of carbon deep dish aero wheels to match! At 19 lbs it's pretty light for a Tri/TT bike. Easier to get up to speed and better on climbs. The full carbon frame and fork means stiffness where you need it for better efficiency. Hard to see in the pictures, but the carbon pattern can be seen under the clear coat and it looks amazing. Ultegra derailluers mean consistent smooth shifting and braking. Wilier's own carbon deep dish wheels are aerodynamic and lightweight, meaning easier to accelerate and then maintain speed. This bike is packed with aero features, like the rear wheel cutout, internal cables, sculpted aero tubing, and tucked rear brake. This bike would be a great first tri bike but also would be an upgrade for a lot of riders. Great condition cosmetically and mechanically. Just serviced professionally and is ready for a new rider. This bike was $3,500 new, and here's why. Check out these specs:,

This cabinet is 100% solid oiled wood – it is NOT pressed board or laminate; see pictures.  Every door and drawer locks for safety.  It will hold 8 rifles or shotguns for display and has felt lining on the support rails (green felt in the pictures).  The drawers easily hold several handguns, sights and/or gun cleaning accessories in each drawer or cabinet.  It stands 76” tall plus ½” for removable wheels (because it is solid wood, it is very heavy) for easy movement, 38” wide and 15-1/2” deep.  The dark pictures were taken w/o flash, the brighter pictures with flash. The last picture shows the solid construction from the back of the cabinet.,
,
This Gun Cabinet is a one-of-a-kind prototype hand-made for potentially adding to the Emperor Clock Company  solid-wood furniture line, but was deemed too expensive to market and was never put into production.  Emperor Clock Company was known in the 70-80’s on The Price is Right for it’s solid, hand-made high-quality grandfather clocks.  This gun cabinet was custom designed and built in approximately 1972 by my father, Theodore Bergeron, General Manager of the company.  Like all of the quality furniture made by them, it is constructed of solid, knot-free, hand-rubbed Cherry or Pecan Hardwood (I’m not the wood expert, my father was…I don’t think it is oak).  There are no composites anywhere. ,
,
I do not have any way to transport it; the buyer will need to make his own moving arrangements.  The width should fit in an SUV with fold-down seats.  NO TEXTing, this is a LAND LINE. Please call or email to view or purchase.  Asking Price is $750.,

Selling my leather jacket -- it's in awesome vintage condition with a patina that only comes from age. I got this from my step-dad when he sold his Harley, and I love it it, but it's just a little too small for me. It's a size 38, and I'm closer to 40 but also, it's cut quite slim. For reference, I'm 5'10"" and about 165 lbs with a measured 35-inch waist (size 33 in most pants).,
,
Brand is British Motorcycle Gear, and the model is the Montana. They still make it, and you can read about it here: https://www.britishmotorcyclegear.com/montana-jacket.html,
,
It apparently comes new with shoulder and elbow armor and a zip-out lining, but I never had those. I wore this on my motorcycle for about 6 months but got tired of having to suck in my gut to zip the thing up :),
,
Leather is soft and supple with no cuts or holes. The lining is perfect, and all the stitching is intact.    ", (SW Gainesville)

I have a huge tank that I was making into a smoker. Don’t have time to finish it. My loss your gain. Doors are already cut and some angle is inside. Needs to be finished. It’s 9’ long. $1000. Will trade for a smoker that is ready to smoke on. Not your Walmart smoker but one on a trailer. Doesn’t have to be a big one but big enough to smoke more than one Boston butt or one slab of ribs. NO JUNK OR PROJECTS PLEASE. Interested in other things as well. Just text me a picture with what you have and let’s see if we can make a trade. Trade plus some cash works to. You will need a trailer and a way to load it. ,

Smoker ready to go,
Home defense items,
Utility trailers,
Log splitter,

Hello all,,
,
This car is an exceptional example of what Porsche creates. Fast and sporty is the best way to describe this vehicle.,
,
The car starts, runs and drives. It has been sitting lately so it would definitely benefit from a tune-up/service.,
,
Only 121,668 on this 30+ year old beauty.,
,
Please do not hesitate to reach out if you have any specific questions that you would like answered.,
,
Price is negotiable, no low ballers.,
,
I can be reached at 86three-20seven-802nine.,
,
Thank you    ", (Winter Haven)

Only the system. It's the ww2 edition and doesn't come with anything. But I guarantee it works and am willing to wait so you can turn it on and try it. ,
Power cord is 5 to 10 bucks. And I do have a controller that works but the left joystick gets stuck a little. You can have the controller if you'd like.    ", (Ocala)

Boer/Kiko Buck * His coloring is Boer how ever there is Kiko in his breeding done for parasite resistance. This Buck has been our herd sire buck but it is time for new blood line. He throws beautiful kids with excellent dispositions and conformation. In the past four years he has only been wormed once and he really did not need it it was just a precaution. Your Buck is the most important goat in your herd he represents 50% of the herd so be sure to get a good one and a proven one is even better. We are offering our best.,

This bus has a new crate engine a 5.9 Cummins. Runs as if new with a turbo. By Jasper Engines. With 10,000 miles since installed,
A Really Solid bus, this has a lot of uses, a tool shed on wheels, an RV homemade of course, a landscape for all the tools, or cut the sides out and haul watermelons. You have 40’ of long stretch useable roof space for cargo.,
https://youtu.be/PUH-dkbipiI Watch the Video, you have to cut and paste to see it..,
,
I also have this tiny home project bus for sale and repurposed with a perfect interior:,
,
https://www.facebook.com/marketplace/item/1727317847567518/,
,
Why not have lots of space for tools and parts and escape the heat in the AC when possible in this game-changing platform you build for your own concept but check the video to see that this interior need not be gutted it can just be modified so you retain all the storage drawers. ,
,
Bluebird with rebuilt front-engine Cummings Turbo crate engine installed 10,000 miles ago. A bay for a 20 KW diesel generator with the wiring and remote start and hardware are presently making a generator install simple.,
I have a generator that will fit the tray.,
,
My main business is buying and selling RV diesel generators, find me on Generator Jeff on Facebook, so I have the appropriate diesel generators if you decide to use it off the grid. ,
,
Removal of the beds is needed to make room for your workspace but the great cabinet space can be left below and in between the beds there’s also drawers and great storage for organizing tools. ,
,
See walk around video and within the description of that walk around video you will find links to other units I reference after first showing the bus in this ad. ,
We can deliver at cost.    ", (Gainesville)

Both of these are classic quality gear for the bass enthusiast and make a well-matched set.  The Peavey Session Bass head is well known for its sound quality and sturdy construction and parametric EQ features.  It includes controls for Pre-Gain, Contour, Low, Mid, Mid-Shift, Highs, and an Output Volume control, as well as a Bright Switch, DDT Compression On/off switch, a Line Out XLR output for feeding a signal to a mixing board or PA System, Effects Send and Return and more.   All the features any performing bassist who plays live or studio music will appreciate and use.,
,
Then there's the vintage Kustom cabinet.   If this amp could talk!  I am the original owner of this cabinet, which was purchased in 1972 from Sam Ash Music in Memphis.  I have kept it in original condition, and even have the distressed cover that came with it.   ,
,
What's great about these Kustom ""tuck-n-roll"" amps is that they have an awesome and unmatched tone for a  2-15 cabinet, and they are built to last.   Cool upholstery, too.  They were made in the US in the 70's until Kustom went with the standard tolex, but for many years this was Kustom's schtick.   ,
,
This is a ported cabinet, which explains the great punchy tone the cabinet produces, but it also increases the sonic output of the cabinet without putting stress on the speakers.  ,
,
Both items work perfectly and are in very good condition.  They have been kept in my non-smoking studio for years, but it's time for me to pass them along to someone who really appreciates the sound and the quality.,
,
Serious buyers only. If that's you, let me know.  But, if you are a foreign spammer, don't waste your time sending me a bogus inquiry - I only respond to local inquiries that include a name and other local information.,
,
I am not looking to separate this set.  But, if you are interested in just the amphead or just the cabinet and your offer is reasonable, I will consider it.    ", (SW Gainesville)

This is a great amp for bass players, keyboardists, synthesizer, or guitarists, and can double as a stage monitor with its unique kickback design.  

Great for playing area clubs, as it has a nice contour (parametric EQ) feature that allows you to shape the midrange tone for the venue.    Hartke combo amps are perfect for both small- and medium-sized venues and project recording situations. ,
,
,
This amp has a very tough, road-worthy cabinet with carpeted exterior, shockproof metal grilles, reinforced corners, and recessed handles. ,
,
,
,
- Revolutionary 2-way (upright and tilt-back) cabinet design for performance, practice, and monitoring,
- Custom Hartke 12 in. aluminum-cone driver,
- 120 Watts @ 8 Ohms,
- Unique ""Shape"" Control for accurate tone-shaping,
- 3-band EQ,
- Passive/Active input jack,
- headphone jack for practicing in your apartment, without disturbing your neighbors, or pre-show tune-ups,
- Balanced XLR Out for connecting to the main P/A system directly using an XLR microphone cable.,
,
,
This prized Hartke Kickback 12 amp design is no longer available as a 120 watt amp, but is now sold only as a big 500 watt amp, only at a much higher price tag.  So, this model is rare and hard to find and perfect for clubs and practicing.,
,
This amp has been well maintained and kept in a clean non-smoking home, with little stage use.   ,

Don’t Worry About Low Park Power Again!,
Today’s RV’s contain advanced electronics including computers, TV’s, satellite receivers, microwave ovens, air conditioners and other sophisticated appliances. Poor power quality entering an RV can not only effect the longevity of electronic equipment and motors, but can lead to thousands of dollars in repairs and create frustrating, unnecessary travel delays.,
In addition, the Surge Guard Voltage Regulators are the first boosters that include intelligence with easy-to-read LED status and fault indication panels. These LED’s show ground status line conditions as well as indicate the under/over voltage conditions of each output line. This product is designed to be fault tolerant so that it can not be damaged by an open neutral that results in high voltage on one of the incoming lines.,
In the Low Voltage (Boost) Mode the Surge Guard Voltage Regulator raises the output voltage by 10% over the incoming line voltage. In the Bypass (No Boost) Mode the unit becomes a bypass element and simply passes the input voltage directly to the output. In the bypass mode the unit exhibits minimal insertion loss.,
Using the Surge Guard Voltage Regulator in conjunction with a Surge Guard® RV power protection product provides the ultimate combination of low voltage and Surge Guard protection. The Surge Guard must be plugged in after or down stream of the Surge Guard Voltage Regulator. A variety of Surge Guard products protect your RV from: High/Low Voltage, Open Neutral, Miswired Pedestals, and Surges.,

Build out your new mobile home from scratch, use for storage, or make $ with scrap metal!  This gutted mobile home is free to the first person to take it and the small pile of trash next to it.  It has the tongue on it and is ready to go.  It does not have wheels, instead its on blocks.  It does have some damage on one corner that you can see in the pictures, otherwise the shell is in very good condition.  Contact me to pick this up right away.    ", (Ocklawaha)

I got this laptop because I decided to go back to to college last fall. After 2 weeks I realized school wasn’t gonna happen at my age, so I just withdrew. So the computer is in better than used condition, but I didn’t want to be deceptive in the description. I still have the computer and I think I wrote 2 papers with it and that’s it. I don’t use it because I have a desktop and it’s just sitting so I figured I’d sell it before they change everything on them, lol.  Also has the case and separate CD player And Microsoft office installed. Feel free to ask questions I’ll do my best answer them    ", (Fort White)

For sale is a very sweet Sony DSC - H300 20.1GB camera. It is new, still in the box. It combines the feel and performance of a DSLR with the convenience of a very sophisticated point and shoot into a powerful camera. It has a 1/2.3"" Super HAD CCD sensor for crisp, sharp images, optical SteadyShot image stabilization, 35x optical zoom, and features that usually need PhotoShop. With the Landscape mode it seamlessly stitches ultra-wide landscapes and group shots in the camera. Other modes include Fireworks, Gourmet, Snow, Soft Skin, Beach, Night Scene, Soft Snap, Night Portrait, PET, High Sensitivity. ,
,
It comes new in the box. It cost $219, and I'm selling it for $129 O.B.O. I can best be reached by text.,
,
I have the junior model to this camera. I love the panoramic mode.  I just scan the scene, turning the camera about 180 degrees side to side, and the camera stitches the whole thing into a single ultra-wide panoramic photo. I know of no other camera that can do that.  this camera can do even more...........    ", (Gainesville)

I have an aluminum boat trailer for sale. I mounted a piece of plywood to it and used it as a utility trailer. I do not have a title / registration for it but with a weight slip and bill of sale it is very easy to register as a homemade trailer at dmv. The trailer does pull true and smooth and will get the job done. The lights and jack work well and I do have the fender that needs to be put back on the trailer. The axle was replaced about a year ago. The tires are in great shape. It will hold a boat approximately up to 18-20 ft. ,
,
Come and get it or I can bring it to you. $900. Call or text 9oh4-613-168oh. Please leave a message if no answer and I will call / text you right back.,
,
**Delivery is available for $20 if needed and if you live within a reasonable distance from me (10 miles or less).,
After 10 miles it is $20 plus $1 per mile for delivery.**,
,
The trailer uses a 2"" ball for hook up. ,

Sorry but I do not have a spare tire for the trailer, what you see in the pictures is what you get.    ", (Hawthorne - Interlachen)

I have just had my second son and have an insane amount of both baby clothes and maternity clothes plus a ton of my old clothes that I can’t fit anymore. Most of the baby clothes are between nb and 12mo, also have some baby girl clothes available. All of my clothes are between 00-3 in women’s. I’ve also got a bunch of random things I no longer have room for and would love to find a new home for. I have no set prices for anything and I’ve got so much I can’t possibly post it all. If there is anything of specific interest to you I will go through and take pictures and give a price. As far as baby clothes nothing will be more than $5. Also if you’d like to just come by and look through what I’ve got just shoot a text and we can work it out.    ", (Gainesville)

Proven A2/A2 young Jersey bull for sale.  Born Oct 2018.  Momma is a registered Jersey, poppa bull is a Jersey with some Guernsey in his lineage.  All of our calves are raised on their mom from day one, and are transitioned to a twice daily bottle of momma's milk halfway to weaning in order to better socialize them to humans.  They are haltered trained from their first week and walk on a lead line as part of their weekly training.  They are handled daily and are always part of a herd while on our farm.  Once separated from their mom, they are cared for by one of our Angus nanny cows, who teach them to respect other herd members, as well as humans.  At a week old, all of our bull calves are dehorned in order to create a friendlier and easier to handle adult bull.,
Riley can be lead on a lead line to cows in heat, and will leave cows in heat when prompted.  He has already successfully bred 2 of our registered Jersey heifers and our lead cow, and is ready to move on to a new herd.  Confirmed A2/A2 documentation is provided with the bull. $1,400.  Transportation to your farm is available for a reasonable fee.  Contact us for an appointment to meet Riley.  References are available upon request as to the quality and temperament of the bulls from our farm.    ","

Selling a 2013 Specialized Tarmac Pro, size 56 cm. This bike was only built last year so it has less than 12 months of riding on it. This bike weighs in at a feathery 16 lbs and features a high quality carbon frame and Ultegra 22 speed groupset. It's lightweight and agile and makes for an excellent climber or sprinter. The carbon is FACT 10r, which is only one step down from what the professionals ride. The Ultegra 22 speed groupset is going to give you a huge range of gears to cover whatever you need it to. Also rolling on a solid set of Mavic wheels. This bike would be a great bike to start but could also be an upgrade for most riders. Great condition cosmetically and mechanically. Just replaced the drivetrain so the chain, cassette, and chainrings have zero miles on them. Just serviced professionally and is ready for a new rider. This bike was $5,000 new, and here's why.

A little about me. I as born in 1953 and my dad owned Rancho Jeep Supply. In 1959 I learned to drive off-road at 6 years old. The 1st vehicle I drove was a military M29 Weasel (picture 17 I am standing my older sister is driving in pic) (basically a tank with the top halve cutoff). Picture 15 is my brother and I on the cover of the 1st 4 color off-road magazine in the world. My dad, Clarence Shook (picture 14) (http://www.gorancho.com/press-releases/the-rancho-brand-the-first-60-years.html ) , was an inventor. In the 1950's he took a World War II Jeep and but a big engine, big brakes, an overdrive, roll bar and made a fun vehicle basically the start of the SUV market that you see today. In the early 1961 my dad, Vic Hickey and 2 of his friends created the Trailblazer (picture 16). This was 4 wheel independent suspension long travel suspension, disc brakes, rack and pinion steering, aluminum body, had 210 horsepower and weighed around 2,000 pounds (went off road like a bat out of H---) In 1964 they sold it to General Motors and in 1967 GMC came out with the Blazer (not at all like the Trailblazer). In 1972 my dad got very sick and I quit college, and with my brother, took over the family business. in the 1970's we designed and invented Rancho Suspension. Which grew to a worldwide business. You can Google GENE SHOOK RANCHO SUSPENSION if you want. In 1990 I sold the company to Tenneco (picture 18 Rancho in 1989)(at the time the 25 largest company in the USA). I retired, I got bored, I bought and sold real estate, I had my own advertising agency, I owned my own commercial real estate brokerage company, I have reviewed over 1,000 commercial lease's, I built buildings (google Hermosa Pavilion 1601 Pacific Coast Hwy Hermosa Beach and I built Rancho buildings picture 18)) , I owned small cafe, small bistro 40 seats, 220 seat high end restaurant (google BRIX@1601 HERMOSA BEACH, CA). And now I sell restaurant equipment and would like to be your restaurant equipment supplier.,
,
Why Atosa? Atosa is a great product with a lot of value. You don't have to break the bank compared to a number of other brands. They are well built. Atosa stands behind there product very well. they have on refrigeration items a 2 year parts and labor warranty and 5 year compressor warranty (year 3 to 5 is parts only on compressor warranty). On there cookline, mixers, slicers and other items it is 1 year parts and labor warranty. Most commercial restaurant equipment manufactures do not warranty items for non commercial use, for food trucks (because they are mobile), Atosa does warrant for non commercial use, food trucks, caterers and so on. I like it when a manufacture believes in there product to give an excellent warranty in all these types of uses. I do not like when some manufactures give a parts only warranty (stay away from these sellers if they don't believe in there product enough to give a good warranty INCLUDING labor then don't buy it). Atosa has a nationwide service department headquartered in Texas. ,
,
TIPS: 1 spend your hard earned money wisely; 2 buy from reputable dealers you can trust and that know the products; 3 Be careful looking at used many are way over priced and more trouble than what they are worth (you can always text me info and I can advise if good deal or not); 4 do not waste money fixing an old worn out item; 5 buy from a dealer that knows the products you need well and can advise you on what is best for you; 6 buy a brand that has a GOOD warranty for your type of use and that covers both parts and labor; 6 CALL ME, TEXT ME, EMAIL ME AND GET GOOD ADVICE.,

A GOOD WARRANTY IS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL ESPECIALLY ON REFRIGERATION ITEMS,
If a vendor does not have enough confidence to stand behind their product with a great warranty then you should not buy from them. Many vendors offer a 5-year warranty on compressor (some have shorter than this) and one-year parts. At glance, this seems okay.,
,
The problem is that they don't offer a warranty on labor. So if something goes wrong you will be stuck paying a repairman $100's of dollars to look at your commercial refrigerator. He will then tell you what parts you need. The parts arrive 2 weeks later. Then you figure out that the parts you ordered did not fix the problem need to reorder parts and pay the repair man more money to come back again to try to fix your problem. In many cases, it takes a long time to get you back in order. In the business world, you can't afford to be out a unit for this long. Many of these offering a poor warranty will hassle you on what warranty they do offer. ,
,
Atosa offer a 2-year PARTS AND LABOR warranty and 5 years on the compressor from the manufacture (for refrigeration and cookline items it is usually 1 year parts and labor). A certified specialist trained specifically on the units will be dispatch to your location and will solve the situation right away. Many business owners love the Atosa warranty and how they handle items if they need service and love avoiding problems they had with other vendors. Another vendor could sell you a similar unit for FEW dollars cheaper but if they won't offer a great warranty then DON'T buy it.,
,
EXPERT ADVISE THAT COULD SAVE YOU from costly mistakes.,
I am one of the largest sellers of MANY BRANDS in the USA. I know refrigeration and cooking equipment extensively. I will help guide you to the proper piece of equipment you truly need. I have actually talked a number of customers out of buying some items because it was not right for them. When you share with me information about your business, I can guide you to the right, precise size and proper piece of equipment you will need. I am knowledgeable about many types of equipment manufacturers and understand the pros and cons of different units.,
Let's WALK THRU AN EXAMPLE,
Suppose you have a 1800 square feet, sit down restaurant with 40 seats plus 20 in outside seating. You serve beer and wine and serve bistro style food. In your kitchen, you use a 12' hood. What should the equipment be under the hood and what size refrigeration items? Assuming a 12' hood, you are required to have 6"" clearance on the left and right side of hood unless you have walls on both sides at end of the hood. So without walls, you have 11' to use on equipment. We will start with a typical layout 3' for stove with 6 burners and oven with 36"" salamander on top of stove, 16"" for fryer 40 pound (if cooking frozen fries go to 50 pound) (remember fryers are a money maker!), 36"" Radiant char grill, 24” griddle, 18"" single or double pot stove. This is your 11' of equipment change menu or style and length of hood and equipment will change. Recommend 60” chef base under griddle and char grill. Remember to keep some low-cost food items on your menu such as pasta, salads, and flat bread pizza. If you need a longer griddle, we can shorten the char broiler and eliminate pot stove or go to 24"" range or cooktop. On refrigeration you would need at least 48"" in sandwich/ salad prep refrigeration normal would be 72"" If you have room in walkways, I suggest going with a Mega for more food pans (mega is 7"" deeper front to back). You should have a 2-door freezer (I prefer bottom mount compressor) but depending on items may get by with 1 door freezer. On refrigeration at least a 3-door refrigerator bottom mount compressor. On bar you have several choices I would need to talk with you to make recommendations. I would start with a 58"" or larger kegerator and 58"" or larger glass door back bar. Remember it is much easier to make money on drinks than it is on food (leave room for money makers)There are many things to discuss from the type of chair and layout (banquette seating on walls and small and large tables being flexible gives you most seats) and so on(too comfortable of chair guest stay to long you lose turns and $$$). it is easy to upset customer and have them tell 10 friends don't go here, it is hard to please customer and have him tell 2 friends to go to you. CUSTOMER is usually always right even when they are wrong (think of marriage) I provide more than just me trying to sell you an item.,
,
SHOULD I BUY NEW OR USED?,
It is always nice to save money, what about good, used equipment? Many refrigerators will last up to 20 years, but I consider the actual lifespan to be about 10 years. If a unit is 10 to 15 years old, there is no real value for the unit even if it is working today. If it is 8 years old you may get some use out of it. It is common that a customer will tell me they found a 2-year-old 2 door freezer for $2000. When I look up the serial numbers it may be 15 plus years' old I find it not to be working properly and really no value( if seller does not know age beware, you can always call manufacture with serial number and they will tell you how old unit is). On working correctly, they say it cools down, but working and working correctly can be a BIG difference. For a freezer, it must reach 0 degrees to negative 10 degrees, on refrigerator it must be between 33 degrees and 40 degrees. So, a freezer at 10 degrees and refrigerator at 45 degrees are working but will not pass a health inspection. When you buy used, they usually don't have a warranty, you have to arrange transport. If it is only a couple years old and it is super cheap you can consider it, but please do not pay a lot for an old unit that may be full of headaches. Many times, I am able to sell a NEW unit at a similar price to what others will sell used, AND new has full warranty.,
WHAT ABOUT THIS BRAND VERSUS ANOTHER BRAND,
there are a lot of great brands and bad brands on the market. Some brands are not any better than ones I sell but they cost a lot more this is not good value for your money. Others can be less but are not as good of quality and offer poor warranty. REMEMBER if a manufacture doesn’t believe in the product enough to offer good warranty (parts AND LABOR) you shouldn’t believe in their brand. Call me and go over any questions on what brand is best for you.,
REBATES could you save a few hundred dollars,
Across the USA many utility companies offer excellent rebates on many of the products we sell for being energy star. Rebates run from $50 to $500 Call us for more details.,
Financing YES, we offer financing but some are high priced if credit is not great, others are low rate if purchasing a lot. Best is to only finance if you have to, keep it short on time AND make sure interest rate is low,

,
ON PROFIT the 30-30-30 rule 10% profit and the actual 50-50-50 and where did all my money go rule. On a typical restaurant you want to break down your expenses into 3 areas; 1st food cost should not be more than 30% (a $3 food cost means you have to charge at least $10 for item) and strive to get to 22% (when you have high food cost item you need to have another low food cost item to offset it); 2nd 30% for labor and related expenses; 3rd 30% all other falls into this rent, utilities, insurance, advertising and so on; 4th 10% PROFIT. On rent it should be no more than 10% of your gross sales but try to get it to 7% of gross sales.,
The 50-50-50 NEGATIVE 50 reality. All of us have watched food shows when they use super expensive food ingredients and super talented and expensive people it is easy to have good food BUT HARD to have profits. Many will estimate really high sales then not meet those sales and end up with 50% food cost, 50% labor cost, and 50% for other cost and wonder why there is no money to pay the bills! Yikes where did the money go? Say you find a great location ½ mile from the super great location rent on 2,000 feet is $4,000 you only need to make $40,000 in sales for a profit and do great if you do $60,000. BUT if you take that A+++ Location and it is 2,000 feet for $18,000 you have to do $180,000 in sales to make sense. Ask yourself will I do 5 times as much business in this expensive location? If not don’t go there. When you open your restaurant it will take time, hard work and a lot of hustle to be a success. Don’t waste money before you open on items you don’t have to. Have a reserve to get through the starting months. AND don’t forget to use a great equipment dealer that can help you with some advice.,

Near mint condition intercooler removed from a low mileage 2013 T5-engined Volvo C30.  It is as perfect as you will ever find.  Should work with any T5-engined Volvo, and is a direct, bolt-on replacement on any P1 platform, like an S40, S60, C70 as well as a few other models.  If you've run over, or into, a curb and damaged your intercooler, here's your low cost replacement.  Volvo charges a ridiculous $1700 for this intercooler!  ,
,
I've seen a few of these intercoolers on Ebay priced for different amounts, along with different amounts for the shipping charges.  To eliminate any cross-shopping, I've priced this one equal to the LOWEST sold price I could find on Ebay.  If you find a lower cost one, prove it to me and, if mine not already sold, I'll match the price!  $75 and it's yours!,

This intercooler could also be used to help the performance of your DIY turbo installation on almost any vehicle.  A friend of mine used this very same intercooler when he installed a turbo kit on his Scion FRS.  Give me a shout at  ,

Celebrate the arrival of football season with a new smoker. My two sons 13 and 17 have built two 120 gallon vertical smoker. The smokers have three racks that can be moved to six different levels. They have a large firebox in the bottom with a large damper and smoke stake also has a damper to enable you to have greater control over the heat.  Feel free to give us a call if you have any questions or would like to come out and pick one up.,
,
I am proud of my boys. Instead of sitting on the couch watching TV they set out on a project. A much bigger project than originally believed. They started with two 120 gallon LP tanks and finished with a nice pair of smokers. But the gained so much more. They built on their already strong work ethic, putting in sometimes 15 to 16 hour work days. They developed metal working skills to include but not limited to welding and using a cutting torch. They grew in independence as well as their ability to work as a team. ,

Thank you for looking at our add and we would greatly appreciate it if you passed it on so we can empty the shop and start on something new.,

This is a rare Roadstar RS420 HH in nice player grade condition. All original hardware and electronics except for a replacement vibrato arm. Includes Gator hardshell case. Please see pics for cosmetic condition. As you can see the finish has yellowed over the years turning the ""Soft Blue"" to a nice seafoam/surfy green. Currently setup and playing well with low action and .10's installed. There is a crack in the finish (pictured) which my luthier has assured me is only cosmetic.,

*New*,
IMAGE shown is TWO traps,
,
Proven Clover design. ,
- Dimensions: 2’ x 2’ x 1’,
- Twelve, 3” openings,
- 4” x 4” chum hold in center,
- Large door on top to dump bait out,
,
- 16 gauge PVC coated 1” x .5” wire top and bottom,
- 19 gauge hot-dipped galvanized after weld, .5” x .5” wire mesh on sides.,
- Stainless steel rings,
,
This trap is a proven clover design that catches bait fast in the right spot with the right bait. Side by side, this trap catches more bait & faster than other, more expensive traps like a ‘Bandito.’ ,
This trap holds up well in saltwater and in the right spot, will catch 75+ pinfish and several small crabs when soaked overnight. ,
If you don’t like this design or material used, I can make whatever trap you would like. These traps are not the easiest or fastest to make, but I make them because they catch more bait and faster. ,
,
I also make Chum Cages that hold a whole brick of chum. And small to medium oval bait pens. Chum cages and bait pens are made from 16 gauge PVC coated wire.,
,
Chum cages, $15,
Bait pens, $60,
,
Traps, $60 FIRM,

,
*All traps all legal in FL and meet FWC guidelines. ,

Cruise America's primary business is renting out Class C motorhomes. They are rented out for about 5 years and my corporate office in Arizona decides when to retire them from our rental fleet and designates a few to be sold to the public. It goes through our refurbishing process where we start by taking off all of the Cruise America graphics, it gets a whole new paint job on the camper and we put the original Majestic graphics back on. Then, we go in the inside to check the appliances; all the appliances need to be in working condition before it's put out for sale. We check the tires/brakes and if they have less than 50% of life on them, they will get new tires/brakes. We even put a 3mo/3,000 powertrain warranty on the engines good at any Ford dealership in the nation. ,

        ,
Original oil painting on canvas by listed artist of 1800s France, A. de Gerville.  Comes from estate of a U.S. diplomat who served and traveled in Europe during the mid-20th Century.  Title is unknown, it's showing a common theme of his then: a street market in Paris with apartments above the shops and flower merchants, lit by hazy sunlight with a cathedral looming behind. The brushwork is loose, apparently from the transitional period between Realism and Impressionism that captivated Europe, then.  It was authenticated by the heirs via the Art Institute of Chicago, but not appraised by them.,
,
A. de Gerville is a listed artist on Artnet, with a history of works at auction in recent decades.  You can be certain you're buying a genuine antique artwork from France.  See other works from past auctions in the last photo.,
,
Size: painting area inside frame's inner edges = 31"" high x 22.5"" wide (frame's outer edges = 36.5""H x 28""W); and weighs ~7.75 lbs in frame.,
,
Condition: surface appears clean with no thick yellowing or varnish.  However the oil on canvas has extensive age related craquelure which is uniformly all over, so it adds to the fact it is an older artwork (even the canvas was made from patched together pieces seen in the rear view photo). The back's craft brown paper was intentionally cut to allow air to breathe with the art front and back alike.  Note the frame is newer, not original or old.    "," (NW Gainesville, FL)"

Antique Early 1900s Native Kansas Walnut 3⁄4 Bed Made by Schmidt Brothers. This is a one-of-a-kind, not a mass produced or brand name make, bed. Made by a woodworker-craftsman using solid native Kansas walnut, not veneer.  Such a bed would be impossible to make today.,
,
Beautiful 3/4 bed frame with headboard, footboard, side rails, and slats, is made of solid walnut (all except for the slats). ""3/4 bed"" means it's not standard size, but you can fit a standard mattress inside and fill the extra space with a thick comforter and/or a quilt.,
,
History: the bed was made for a wealthy Kansas farming family, the Schmidt Brothers. Ideal for a homeowner or BnB with affinity for timeless American antiques. ,
,
Condition: Very Good condition for its age, minor wear and tear commensurate for it's age and use, minor water damage at one side rail and at one corner of headboard (see pics).,

Dimensions: Overall = 78""L x 54""W; Headboard = 54""W x 58 3⁄4""H x 2""D; Footboard = 54""W x 24""H x 2 1⁄2""D; Mattress area = 49"" W x 74 3⁄4""L.    ", (SW Gainesville)

The footboard adapts to (I believe) queen-bed size.  Meaning, once you swap out the sides of the crib for a bedframe, you elongate the crib, converting it into a regular bedframe.  You would use the back wall of the crib as the headboard, and then the front wall of the crib can be converted into two different styles for a footboard, since the curved uprights on either side are detachable from the middle wall piece.  Either keep the front crib wall for a tall footboard, or use the matching crossmember (included but not pictured) to create a low-profile footboard that just has the curved uprights at full height.  This could be better explained in-person.  These bed units usually go for about two hundred.,

This set is older Thomasville furniture, several decades old, incredibly heavy & solid.  All pieces have been thoroughly cleaned and are in great shape, but there are minor areas of concern in several places, like spots of woodstain needing a recoat, several missing handle hardwares, etc., so this could be a minor project for someone who wants to refurbish the units.  I'd be happy to point out all flaws in person.  I have considered all issues of the set and set my asking price accordingly, which I feel is a very fair deal, bearing in mind that this is a REAL WOOD SET.  So, if I cannot sell these as-is for ,, I intend to completely sand down and repaint this entire set before selling at a much higher price.   ,
,
There are three furniture units in total, but, technically, seven separate pieces of furniture:,
,
UNIT 1) One headboard with three dual-chambered cupboards behind each of the fold-down doors which house a removal partition inside to separate the chambers (will make sense when you see them in person).  The headboard sits flush between two bedside wardrobe towers, lightsockets in each of these at bed level for bedtime reading, etc., as well as a pull-out shelf to rest drink glasses, books, etc., also at bed level.  One lightbar connects the two bedside towers, and has three lightsockets, sitting directly above the headboard.,
headboard 40"" T x 64"" W x 17"" D,
towers [x2] 78"" T x 26"" W x 18"" D,
lightbar 5"" T x 64"" W x 17"" D,
,
UNIT 2) One dresser with folding mirror that fastens along the backside and sits on top, both outer partitions of the mirror can fold inward or sit flat against wall, and you can freely move them at-will once mounted (they're not locked into any position at any point).,
dresser 32"" T x 70"" W x 19"" D,

UNIT 3) Armoire.,

Beam Antennas for the 432 MHz ham band For Sale:,
,
I have a couple of M2 beam antennas for sale.,
M2 antennas are usually considered to be one of,
the best brands.,
,
One of the things that sets M2 antennas apart is,
that the elements in these beams are insulated,
from the boom. Apparently this gives the beams,
better performance.,
,
Both of these work fine, and look extremely,
good. They have stainless steel hardware, so corrosion,
is not a problem.,
They can be mounted either horizontally or vertically.,

This ATS belongs to my 85 year old mother who lives on Amelia Island. Purchased from Lindsay Cadillac in Arlington, VA. Although it is a Performance Model it has all available options because it was the Sales Managers demo car. I can not list all of the options, it is easier to say what it doesn't have. The only options I have not been able to find are: no heads up display, no power folding mirrors.,
Car has always been serviced by Cadillac and GMC in Yulee. All records are available since the day she purchased it. Always garage kept.,
Brand new CUE Infotainment Center, just replaced 7/9/2019. New Battery, oil just changed and tires rotated.,
The car has had body work done because of minor accident and my Mom believes bumpers are there for a reason but all work performed by Cadillac approved body shops.,
Interior is spotless and still has that ""new car smell"" and the only visible flaws on the exterior are a small door ding on the left rear passenger door, a small chip by the fog light on the right front, and a small chip between the right fender and the right passenger door, see pictures. I included the Vin# if you want get a Carfax report.,
All manuals included.,
Tires have 30-35% tread, This is literally a great grandmothers car only driven on Sundays! Just kidding but it is an awesome car and I don't think you could find one any where else at this price. It is not being driven right now as Mom has already purchased a new car.,
Cash Only! No Dealers! Email me if you want any further information.    ", (Keystone Heights)

Description  Like brand new!,
Automatic bale wagon, great at saving time in the field picking up round bales. Turns bales in field so can travel in same path of baler, unloads in double straight line for ease of storing or wrapping.,
Unbeatable Performance - Less Machinery, More Efficiency.,
Tube-line introduces one of the safest, fastest and easiest ways to move round bales from the field, all that and less,

The Techno-Bale models are the result of a process of constant improvements that has resulted in efficient, reliable and durable round bale handling equipment.,
 Move bales safely, easily, and fast with less compaction,
 Adjustable lift arm is designed to give the bale a spin before picking it up, so you can follow the path of the,
baler,
 Adjustable racks to fit various bale sizes,
 Hydraulic functions from loading to unloading cycles with the flip of a switch,
 All models unload bales in a line for easy access for wrapping or storage,

Good LED lighting is connected to a 4 wire flat plug.  Tires are low boy, not mobile home. ,

The right fender is ugly due to a truck riding over it but there is no tire rub.  New one is $137 at TSC.,

The spare may not hold air, truly do not remember, get a tube.  ,

The deck is 16' not counting tongue.  The price is firm, may consider partial trade.,

I have a briggs 3 hp engine for sale. I took this off of my son's go kart to put a bigger engine on it since he has grown. The carb has been rebuilt. It runs and idles well but it does smoke a little when you hit the throttle. I'm guessing maybe rings or valve but I'm not really sure. I'm including the clutch and chain as well with the engine. I can also text a couple of videos of it running that I took today. I haven't started the engine in about 6 months and it started on the 2nd pull today. ,

Come and get it or I can bring it to you. $80. Call or text 9oh4-613-168oh.,

Laminate countertops are highly durable, very easy to maintain and in comparison to granite, solid surface, or quartz are very reasonably priced. ,
,
Laminate manufacturers have come along way. They have completely updated and modernized their inventories so you can find a huge variety of styles and natural looking materials including granite, marble and woodgrains. ,
,
We offer all brands of laminate including Formica and Wilsonart. We offer several edging profiles including square edging, bevel edging, crescent, bullnose or ogee edges. Our countertops are constructed from 100% plywood and professional grade adhesive glue. ,
,
We offer free quotes when you email us your countertop layout or we will come and measure for you for $75 (this will be applied to your contracted job as a credit). ,
,
We are licensed, insured and accept credit cards. 904-796-3775.,
